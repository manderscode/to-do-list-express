# To-Do List - Built with Express

This is a simple to-do list full stack web application that allows the user to add tasks to the list, clear the entire list, and cross-off completed items.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned 

Initially this project was created on the front-end, so ensuring it worked properly from the back-end was definitely a challenge. I'm glad I have more practice with CRUD and back-end development. I believe it would have been easier to start from scratch making a new to-do list than to turn a previous front-end project into a full-stack.
